Introduction
---

This is an <s>old</s> experiment, i try to make this a complete functional **cms**.
with full support for webshops, blogs, landingpages *built-in*.

If you want to help, thanks in advance!

Goals
---

- Do not use a framework like 'Yii'
- Leave the application opensource, and public domain
- Happy users, happy visitors.
